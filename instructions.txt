           Instructions for Extra Engineering Presets           
----------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT:
 This tool allows you to have more than 10 engineering presets.
 
 This consists of two programs:
 1) An autohotkey script that detects your keypresses and
    relays them to the second program
 2) A java program that receives info about keypresses and
    talks to the Artemis server to set your ship's power and
    coolant
 
 You'll need java runtime (at least version 8) installed.


TO CONFIGURE PRESETS:
 Edit presets.txt.
 You can change which file is used for presets in config.ini.

TO START:
 1. Open config.ini
 2. Set serverAddress to the IP address of the artemis server
 3. Set shipNumber to which ship to board (1 through 8)
 4. Save config.ini
 5. Ensure your Artemis server is up and running
 6. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe"
 7. A console window should open and a green H icon should
    appear in your tray.
    (The console window is the java program that connects to
    the Artemis server.)
    (The green H tray icon is the autohotkey script that
    detects keypresses.
 8. Look at the console window and verify that it has connected
    to the server and has boarded your intended ship number.
 9. Play Artemis!
    Your keystrokes should only trigger the presets when you
    have focus on an artemis window with engineering open.
    If the server crashes, you'll have to restart.

TO RESTART:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe" again

TO CLOSE:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Press any preset keybind
    OR Hit Ctrl+Esc
    OR Right-click the green-H tray icon, and select Exit


If you have questions, ask Quaris.

Massive credit to the Interface for Artemis Networking (IAN)
project and everyone who has reverse-engineered Artemis's
network packets structure. Without this prior work this tool
would not be possible.
