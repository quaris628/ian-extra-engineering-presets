           Instructions for Extra Engineering Presets           
----------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT:
 This tool allows you to have more than 10 engineering presets.
 It uses autohotkey to detect keypresses, and sets power
 and coolant levels via an independent network connection
 to the game server.

 The keybinds will only trigger when you have an artemis
 window focused and have the engineering console active!
 For example, if you keep engineering claimed while you go on
 a shuttle expedition, your presets won't trigger from your
 keypresses you're using to pilot the shuttle.

 You'll need java runtime installed.
 (At least version 8, I think. I'm not entirely sure.)


TO CONFIGURE PRESETS:
 Edit presets.txt.
 You can change which file is used for presets in config.ini.

TO START:
 1. Ensure your settings (like server IP address)
    are set in config.ini
 2. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe".
 A console window should open, and a green H icon should
 appear in your system tray.
 Look at the console window and verify that it has connected
 to the server and has boarded your intended ship number.

 If the server crashes, you'll have to restart this tool.

TO RESTART:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe" again

TO STOP:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Press any preset keybind
    OR Hit Ctrl+Esc
    OR Right-click the green-H tray icon, and select Exit


If you have questions, find bugs, etc, go to Quaris.


Massive credit to the Interface for Artemis Networking (IAN)
project and everyone who has reverse-engineered Artemis's
network packets structure. Without this prior work this tool
would not be possible.
