           Instructions for Extra Engineering Presets           
----------------------------------------------------------------

 This requires java runtime to work.
 (At least version 8, I think. I haven't tested to verify.)

-------------------------- HOW TO... ---------------------------

CONFIGURE:
 - Edit config.ini to change server IP and other misc settings.
 - Edit presets.txt to change engineering presets.
   Optionally, you can have multiple preset txt files,
   and set which to load in config.ini.

START:
 Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe".
 (Watch the console window, and verify it connects to the IP and
    to the correct ship.)

If the artemis server crashes, you'll have to restart.
Restarting reloads all settings, including presets.
RESTART:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe" again

STOP:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Press any preset keybind
    OR Hit Ctrl+Esc
    OR Right-click the green-H tray icon, and select Exit

------------------- LOGGING USAGE STATISTICS -------------------
Optionally, you can generate a log file with data on how many
  times you used each preset and how long each preset was active
  (before another preset was triggered).

To generate a log file:
  Type "LOG" into the console and hit enter.
  The file will be saved to the /logs/ folder.

Remarks:
  All presets since starting/restarting are logged.
  (Generating a log file doesn't reset what data is included.)
  If the same preset key is pressed multiple times in a row
    within a half second, then only one preset use is logged.
    (The preset is still applied multiple times though.)

--------------------- HOW IT WORKS ---------------------------

 This tool is composed of two programs that run simultaneously.
 Keypress detection is done with an AutoHotKey script.
 Setting the power and coolant is done with a java program
   that communicates directly with the game server.
   (Forked from IAN: https://github.com/rjwut/ian)
 The tray icon is the AutoHotKey script.
 The console window is the java program.
 AutoHotKey sends keystrokes to the java program by typing
   their codes into the java program's console. Luckily,
   it can do this without shifting window focus.
 ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe is the AutoHotKey script, and
   when it starts, it starts the java program automatically.
   The java program technically can run alone, but AutoHotKey
   only sends keystrokes to the java program that it starts.

 By default, the keybinds will only trigger presets when you
   have an artemis window focused AND have the engineering
   console active.
 Why this guardrail exists:

 Detecting if the engineering console is selected is done by
   testing pixel colors at the center of the first 4 "bulb"s
   on each console tab, and then testing pixel colors on the
   E in the ENGINR word.
 Since the eastern front mod uses orange colors instead of blue,
  different color checks are needed for it. This is the reason
  for the isEasternFront setting in config.ini.
