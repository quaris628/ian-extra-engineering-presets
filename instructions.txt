           Instructions for Extra Engineering Presets           
----------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------- HOW TO... ---------------------------

CONFIGURE PRESETS:
 Edit presets.txt.
 You can change which file is used for presets in config.ini.

START:
 1. Ensure your settings (like server IP address)
    are set in config.ini
 2. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe".
 A console window should open, and a green H icon should
 appear in your system tray.
 Look at the console window and verify that it has connected
 to the server and has boarded your intended ship number.

 If the server crashes, you'll have to restart this tool.

RESTART:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Run "ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe" again

STOP:
 1. Close the command line window
 2. Press any preset keybind
    OR Hit Ctrl+Esc
    OR Right-click the green-H tray icon, and select Exit

---------------------- LOGGING STATISTICS ----------------------
Optionally, you can generate a log file with data on how many
 times you used each preset and how long each preset was active
 (before another preset was triggered). This only logs presets
 used since this tool was started/restarted.
To generate, type "LOG" into the console and hit enter.
The file will be saved to a /logs/ folder inside the tool's
 main directory.

----------------------- ABOUT/MISC -----------------------------

 You'll need java runtime installed.
 (At least version 8, I think. I'm not entirely sure.)

 The keybinds will only trigger when you have an artemis
   window focused AND have the engineering console active.
 Mistake that caused me to make this guardrail:

 Detecting if the engineering console is selected is done by
   testing pixel colors at the center of the first 4 "bulb"s
   on each console tab, and then testing pixel colors on the
   E in the ENGINR word.
 Since the eastern front mod uses orange colors instead of blue,
  different color checks are needed for it. This is the reason
  for the isEasternFront setting in config.ini.

 This tool is composed of two programs that run simultaneously.
 Keypress detection is done with an AutoHotKey script.
 Setting the power and coolant is done with a java program
   that communicates directly with the game server.
   (Forked from IAN: https://github.com/rjwut/ian)
 The tray icon is the AutoHotKey script.
 The console window is the java program.
 AutoHotKey sends keystrokes to the java program by typing
   their codes into the java program's console. Luckily,
   it can do this without shifting window focus.
 ExtraEngineeringPresets.exe is the AutoHotKey script, and
   when it starts, it starts the java program automatically.
   The java program technically can run alone, but AutoHotKey
   only sends keystrokes to the java program that it starts.

Without this prior work this tool would not be possible:

- The Interface for Artemis Networking (IAN) java source code
