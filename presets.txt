; Notes:
;
; Be mindful of overlaps with your other engineering keybinds.
; ESPECIALLY be mindful of your presets for storing keybinds.
; It's an easy mistake to add extra presets for Shift+1, etc.
; and not change your keybinds for storing presets.
; (To change your Artemis keybinds, edit controls.ini.)
;
; These extra presets have a slightly longer input delay
; compared to the 10 true presets. I haven't quantified the
; difference, but I recommend using the true presets for
; panic and/or combat settings that need to be fast.


; File Format:
; 
; Each preset must be 9 consecutive lines.
; 
; Line 1 = the keybind. e.g. "1" or "Q"
;   Each keybind is assumed to be unique.
;   You can specify modifiers by adding prefixes.
;     Shift = +
;     Ctrl = ^
;     Alt = !
;     Win = #
;     For example, "+Q" is Shift+Q
;   More advanced keybinds are possible. Any autohotkey (v2)
;     keybind will work. Full documentation:
;     https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Hotkeys.htm
;
; Lines 2-9 = the power, followed by the coolant
;   Power must be an integer between 0 and 300 (inclusive).
;   Coolant must be an integer between 0 and 8 (inclusive).
;   Power and coolant should be separated by one tab character.
