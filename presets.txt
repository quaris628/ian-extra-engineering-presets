; This is a comment.

; Format for each preset:
; It must be 9 consecutive lines.
; Line 1 = the keybind. e.g. Q or 1.
;   Any autohotkey keybind will work (e.g. ^Q for Ctrl+Q).
;   Each keybind is assumed to be unique.
; Lines 2-9 = the power followed by the coolant
;   Power must be an integer between 0 and 300 (inclusive).
;   Coolant must be an integer between 0 and 8 (inclusive).
;   Power and coolant should be separated by one tab character.

; Note that these extra presets have a very slightly
; longer delay between when you hit your key and when
; the game server updates the power and coolant levels
; compared to the 10 true presets.
; If those fractions of a second in applying your presets
; matter to you (which they do for me sometimes), I recommend
; using the 10 true presets for all your combat presets
; and use your extra presets for things that can wait
; like idling or scouting.
